# swcimposters

This SwcImposters project is intended to contain OpenGL GLSL shader source code that can be used to implement efficient rendering of large numbers of imposter spheres, and imposter truncated cones connecting pairs of consecutive spheres. These two types of primitives are oriented toward rendering neuron structures expressed in SWC format.
